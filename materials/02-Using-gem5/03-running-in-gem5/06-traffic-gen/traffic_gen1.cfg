# This is an example configuration file for gem5's TrafficGen.
# It defines different types of memory traffic streams.
# --- Linear Traffic Stream ---
# This stream generates memory accesses in a linear fashion.
# It's useful for simulating sequential data access patterns.
INIT 0
[linear_read_stream]
type=linear
# The memory range for this traffic stream.
# Format: start_address:end_address (inclusive)
# Ensure this range falls within your system's defined memory ranges (e.g., 0x80000000 to 0x80000000 + size).
# Here, we target 0x80000000 to 0x80000000 + 1MB (0x100000 bytes).
range=0x80000000:0x80100000
# The size of each memory request in bytes.
# Common values are 64 bytes (for cache lines) or 4 bytes (for word accesses).
request_size=64
# The total number of requests to generate for this stream.
num_requests=100000
# The stride between consecutive memory accesses.
# If request_size is 64 and stride is 64, it's a perfect sequential access.
stride=64
# The operation type: 'Read' or 'Write'.
op_type=Read
# --- Random Traffic Stream ---
# This stream generates memory accesses to random addresses within a specified range.
# It's useful for simulating irregular or scattered data access patterns.
[random_write_stream]
type=random
# The memory range for this traffic stream.
# Here, we target 0x40000000 to 0x40000000 + 512KB (0x80000 bytes).
range=0x40000000:0x40080000
# The size of each memory request in bytes.
request_size=32
# The total number of requests to generate for this stream.
num_requests=50000
# The operation type: 'Read' or 'Write'.
op_type=Write
# --- Optional Global Parameters (can be added if needed) ---
# These parameters can be set globally for the TrafficGen,
# or overridden by individual stream definitions.
# For example, if you want to limit the total requests per tick:
# max_requests_per_tick=100
